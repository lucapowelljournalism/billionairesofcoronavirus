        <p>Billionaires. You love to hate them. But in a pandemic, well, everyone hopes they do something useful.<br><br>And some of them did. You can decide where it was 'good' or not. Certainly many billionaires felt the call to do something,
          whether
          it was donating a lot of money, a little bit of money, or simply making waves with terrible, terrible takes
          (looking at you, Elon).<br><br>

          <p class="content">He was China’s richest person. Now, he may also be one of its most well-known, particularly in countries receiving medical supply airdrops stamped with his last name.

            <br><br>Since February, Ma has liberally moved much needed medical equipment around the world. When Iran was an epi-center, there came Ma with 1 million masks to contribute. When South Korea got hit by its first wave, it was the same
            story. Italy, Malaysia, Thailand, Ethiopia, the United States, each one has been a recipient of Ma’s goodwill.

            <br><br>He’s taken on the mantle of the billionaire the world needs. Still, not everyone’s sure about his motives. Are his donations as genuine as his Twitter account would like us to believe? Or are his actions another arm of Chinese
            soft power abroad?

            <br><br>Take his many donations to countries in Africa, a continent which China has played a significant role in developing through loans and trade in the 21st century. Even African thinkers have questioned if his donations are really
            what Africa needs, or if they are simply a way for Ma to curry goodwill towards China on the continent.

            <br><br>It’s not hard to imagine why. The sheer economic might of Alibaba in Asia has made Ma a big player in Chinese politics. And while he’s been sending ventilators around the world, many other top Chinese players have been playing a
            different diplomatic game: deflecting blame for coronavirus onto countries like the United States through state-run media channels. The facelift on China’s image, tarnished by the outbreak in Wuhan, has more than form.

            <br><br>Regardless, his presence in the global fight against COVID-19 has been ubiquitous. Over 150 countries have received his donations, according to data from Alizila. He’s donated over 120 million facemasks, 4 million testing kits,
            and 3,700 ventilators.

          <p class="content">If he could save the world with a check, he would have by now.<br><br>

            Gates has long been a leading figure in the world of international relief. He was on the forefront of Ebola relief in 2014. A year later he went on to give a now famous Ted talk that would prove prescient. It’s title: “The Next Outbreak?
            We’re not ready.”<br><br>

            By contrast, Gates has sought to model preparedness. His foundation is heavily funding vaccine trials around the world. It’s also looking ahead to the heavy lift of manufacturing and distributing some 7 billion doses around the world. His
            vaccine organization, Gavi, will likely be a key player: the nonprofit coordinates vaccine distribution in developing countries.<br><br>

            Simply by having been so involved for so long in this wheelhouse, Gates has established himself as a global health expert in his own right. He’s often on cable news, and his press releases now get wide replay across news sites of all
            stripes.<br><br>

            Including, of course some conspiracy theories, like that Gates engineered the virus to turn a profit. Those theorists have proposed his vaccine distribution network is how he would do that. People who actually know science have pointed
            out how vaccines are ‘dramatically less profitable’ than people think. Touche, Johns Hopkins.<br><br>

            Gates has publicly stated he will happily lose billions to make this vaccine happen. As it stands, he’s funding 7 different trials, with the plan of abandoning the five least promising.<br><br>

            “It’ll be a few billion dollars we’ll waste on manufacturing for the constructs that don’t get picked because something else is better. But a few billion in this situation we’re in, where there’s trillions of dollars...being lost
            economically, it is worth it,” Gates said.</p>

          <img src="charleskoch.jpg">
          <p class="content">Who was the most surprised by an international pandemic?<br><br>

            Charles Koch would be a safe bet, if only because the man has spent so long trying to defund the CDC. In 2018, Koch’s Americans For Prosperity lobbied for $1 billion in cuts to the CDC. They argued the organization's funding had grown
            significantly in 15 years, and that its public health services were ‘duplicative’.<br><br>

            When Covid-19 hit, the AFP then began advocating against stay-at-home orders across the country. In several statements, the group called the orders the “wrong approach” and that “all businesses are essential.” That advice contradicts
            medical experts at the top, and yet despite that, some say that languages has found a receptive ear in the president. Trump has also publicly toyed with the idea of reopening.<br><br>

            At a net worth of 40 billion, Charles Koch’s influence is massive. The AFP is just one arm of his network that is mixed up in the coronavirus response. Koch industries employs over 130,000 workers. Koch also owns Georgia-Pacific, a
            toilet-paper producer - sorry, “bath tissue” - among other things. It also owns Phillips Medisize, a medical device producer that makes test kits. In a statement, the company said they would be ‘transforming production lines in order to
            meet the growing demand for life saving medical devices.”<br><br>

            So Koch is either innovating his way through an economic collapse, or simply positioning himself to hold all the cards when the federal demand for test kits soars.<br><br>

            One of Koch’s orgs, Stand Together, has announced that they are donating a total of $5 million dollars directly to families in sums of $500 each. It’s also donating over $5 million to community-based nonprofits.<br><br>

            Notably, a small amount of that pot has come from Koch’s own coffers. Most of it is raised publicly.<br><br>

            Recently, the AFP has broken with former tea-party groups who’ve supported shutdown protests across the country. The decision not to take part in shutdown protests was notable. Americans for Prosperity CEO Emily Seidel said she “did not
            believe rejecting the advice of public health experts made sense.”<br><br>

            The same health experts Koch has long tried to defund.<br><br>
