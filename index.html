        <p class="content">Who was the most surprised by an international pandemic?<br><br>

          Charles Koch would be a safe bet, if only because the man has spent so long trying to defund the CDC. In 2018, Koch’s Americans For Prosperity lobbied for $1 billion in cuts to the CDC. They argued the organization's funding had grown
          significantly in 15 years, and that its public health services were ‘duplicative’.<br><br>

          When Covid-19 hit, the AFP then began advocating against stay-at-home orders across the country. In several statements, the group called the orders the “wrong approach” and that “all businesses are essential.” That advice contradicts
          medical experts at the top, and yet despite that, some say that languages has found a receptive ear in the president. Trump has also publicly toyed with the idea of reopening.<br><br>

          At a net worth of 40 billion, Charles Koch’s influence is massive. The AFP is just one arm of his network that is mixed up in the coronavirus response. Koch industries employs over 130,000 workers. Koch also owns Georgia-Pacific, a
          toilet-paper producer - sorry, “bath tissue” - among other things. It also owns Phillips Medisize, a medical device producer that makes test kits. In a statement, the company said they would be ‘transforming production lines in order to
          meet the growing demand for life saving medical devices.”<br><br>

          So Koch is either innovating his way through an economic collapse, or simply positioning himself to hold all the cards when the federal demand for test kits soars.<br><br>

          One of Koch’s orgs, Stand Together, has announced that they are donating a total of $5 million dollars directly to families in sums of $500 each. It’s also donating over $5 million to community-based nonprofits.<br><br>

          Notably, a small amount of that pot has come from Koch’s own coffers. Most of it is raised publicly.<br><br>

          Recently, the AFP has broken with former tea-party groups who’ve supported shutdown protests across the country. The decision not to take part in shutdown protests was notable. Americans for Prosperity CEO Emily Seidel said she “did not
          believe rejecting the advice of public health experts made sense.”<br><br>

          The same health experts Koch has long tried to defund.<br><br>
