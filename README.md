How the Javascript works:
TC helped me to code javascript that does this:
1) Takes a click on a 'tile'. 'Tiles' are the same as the pictures of each person in the interactive.
2) Runs a function which gets the data from the tile.
  2a) The data in each tile is #**\_\_** with that person's name following the #.
    2a ex: data-target=""#jackma" gives the data #jackma
3) The function saves that data to a variable named target.
4) Javascript then turns on the active class for target.
  4a) Also removes the active class on any other outputs that are currently active.

To do:

-   Build in graphs to the displays.
-   Decide on a thematic color scheme.
-   Fix css so that the display boxes don't overlap with the text below.
-   Write in the actual content.
